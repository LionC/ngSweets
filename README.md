# ngSweets
A collection of useful general-purpose angular candies!

(Candies as in directives and services ;-)

#How to install
Just run
```bash
bower install ng-sweets
```
If you don't have bower installed, [you can get it here](http://bower.io).
**ngSweets** obviously depends on **angular(version 1.4.5 and any 1.x above)**, so bower will download it if it is not already installed per bower. If you are already using a compatible version of angular, you can delete the one bower downloads.

**For the documentation on how to use ngSweets see the Wiki**
