# ngSweets
A collection of useful general-purpose angular candies!

(Candies as in directives and services ;-)

#How to install and use
##Per bower
Just run
```bash
bower install ng-sweets
```
and include the `dist/ngsweets.js` in your HTML somewhere after your angular.js.

If you don't have bower installed, [you can get it here](http://bower.io).
**ngSweets** obviously depends on **angular(version 1.4.5 and any 1.x above)**, so bower will download it if it is not already installed per bower. If you are already using a compatible version of angular, you can delete the one bower downloads.

##Without bower
Simply download the [ngsweets.js](tree/master/dist/ngsweets.js) file and include in in your HTML somewhere after your angular.js.

**For the documentation on how to use ngSweets see the [Wiki](//github.com/LionC/ngSweets/wiki/)**
